            There is no one approach that works for lasting weight loss and
            dieting alone is definitely not enough. Long-term weight
            loss and management might involve a combination of
            different medical options. Working closely with your
            provider to design a plan suited to your condition, lifestyle and{" "}
             other needs is the best way to go.
